In May 2014, the band was nominated for fourteen Billboard Music Awards, including Top Artist of the Year and a Milestone Award, which recognizes innovation and creativity of artists across different genres. In April 2018, the band was nominated eleven more times for Billboard Music Awards.
Imagine Dragons are based in Las Vegas, so it\u0027s fitting that they laid down their first full album inside a casino. The band recorded Night Visions at Studio X, a recording studio that\u0027s housed inside Palms Casino Resort. According to a report by Vegas Seven, the Palms also has a second studio called Studio Y and claims that artists can record music from any other room at the Palms. Imagine Dragons went on to win a 2014 Billboard Music Award for Top Rock Album for Night Visions, among five BBMA\u0027s they earned that year, so this unique recording arrangement obviously worked out okay.
Rounding out the decade-end Top Rock Albums top five is Imagine Dragons\u0027 Evolve, which holds the record for most weeks at No. 1 on Top Rock Albums: 24, beginning in July 2017. To date, the set has yet to leave the weekly list\u0027s top 20.
The genre-splicing, socially conscious and streaming-dominant Vegas quartet has cemented itself as by far the year\u0027s most successful rock band. But who, outside of their fans, is actually taking notice?
For Smoke + Mirrors, their second album, Las Vegas band Imagine Dragons placed game and film syncs front and centre and the live plot was tightly woven into the album marketing. Liz Goodwin, head of campaign strategy at Polydor Records, and Maddy Smith, senior digital campaign manager at Polydor Records, explain how the inclusion of streaming into the UK albums chart is directly affecting long-term marketing pushes, why playlists can be used to take fans deeper into the album, where retargeting delivers the best results and why there is no such thing as \"a quiet time\" in the record business any more.
Here are the albums by Imagine Dragons: Night Visions, Infinity Blade III, Transformers: Age of Extinction, The Divergent Series: Insurgent, Smoke + Mirrors, Evolve, Suicide Squad: The Album, Passengers, Origins
The imagine dragons band released their third studio album, Evolve (2017) which resulted in three chart-topping singles, \"Believer\", \"Thunder\", and \"Whatever It Takes\", also making them the artist with the most weeks at number-one on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart.

After 2015 follow-up Smoke + Mirrors, 2017\u0027s Evolve found the band back to generating multiple hit tracks, including \"Believer\", \"Thunder\" and \"Whatever It Takes\". Latest LP Origins arrived in 2018, furthering Imagine Dragons\u0027 success across multiple radio formats and genre-based playlists.
The imagine dragons band\u0027s second studio album Smoke + Mirrors (2015) reached number one in the US, Canada and the UK. The album was preceded by the top 40 single \"I Bet My Life\", and second and third singles, \"Gold\" and \"Shots\". The band then embarked on a ten month long world tour, which led to a brief hiatus in 2016, with occasional performances and soundtrack contributions throughout the remainder of the year.
Here are a list of Imagine Albums Singles: \"It\u0027s Time\", \"Radioactive\", \"Hear Me\", \"Demons\", \"On Top of the World\", \"Monster\", \"Battle Cry\", \"Warriors\", \"I Bet My Life\", \"Gold\", \"Shots\", \"Roots\", \"I Was Me\", \"Sucker for Pain\", \"Levitate\", \"Believer\", \"Thunder\", \"Whatever It Takes\", \"Next to Me\", \"Born to Be Yours\", \"Natural\", \"Zero\", \"Machine\", \"Bad Liar\", \"Birds\"
Self-identifying as \"genreless\" Imagine Dragons joined forces with producers like Joel Little (Lorde, Khalid), Mattman \u0026 Robin (Selena Gomez, Carly Rae Jepsen), and John Hill (Florence + the Machine, Phantogram) to sculpt the kaleidoscopic and kinetically charged sound of Origins. With the band artfully blending rock, hip-hop, pop, and folk, the album is etched in inventive textures that never distract from an essential element of Imagine Dragons: lyrics that speak to a sometimes-painful self-awareness, but ultimately uplift and inspire.
Imagine Dragons have the top three rock songs of the 2010s on the Billboard charts, \"Believer\", \"Thunder\", and \"Radioactive\".
Top Artists recaps are ranked based on a formula blending performance, as outlined above, of all their chart entries. Specifically, the overall Top Artists category ranks the best-performing artists based on activity on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart and the Billboard 200 albums tally, as well as social media data and touring revenue from Billboard Boxscore, while genre-focused Top Artists rankings blend acts\u0027 decade-spanning performance on each genre\u0027s main song and album charts (such as, for rock, Hot Rock Songs and Top Rock Albums).
Elsewhere on Origins, the band reflects on the many dimensions of romantic love, embodying everything from the restless intensity of \"Boomerang\" to the dreamy melancholy of \"Cool Out\" to the epic balladry of \"Bad Liar.\" And on the soulful and stomping \"West Coast,\" Reynolds muses on a \"fear of neglecting relationships due to the career path I chose,\" gently transforming that fear into a glorious piece of folk-pop.

Afterwards, \"Machine\" and \"Bad Liar\" were also released. A previously released single titled \"Born to Be Yours\" was included on a deluxe version of the album. While all four albums were commercially successful, critical reception was mixed.
Noting that the past year has brought its share of \"high highs and low lows,\" Reynolds partly perceives Origins as a document of those triumphs and troubles. \"I don\u0027t believe in regrets, but in accepting my path where I am each day,\" he says. \"I wrote in the moment, and this record captures a lot of visceral feelings for me -- some of it lamenting loss, some celebrating life. I can\u0027t help but write from an emotional and vulnerable place, as it\u0027s the only place of inspiration for me that\u0027s real.\"
