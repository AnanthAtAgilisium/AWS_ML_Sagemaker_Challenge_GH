Imagine Dragons have four albums to their band collection: Night Visions, Smoke + Mirrors, Evolve and Origins
After 2015 follow-up Smoke + Mirrors, 2017\u0027s Evolve found the band back to generating multiple hit tracks, including \"Believer\", \"Thunder\" and \"Whatever It Takes\". Latest LP Origins arrived in 2018, furthering Imagine Dragons\u0027 success across multiple radio formats and genre-based playlists.
The imagine dragons band\u0027s second studio album Smoke + Mirrors (2015) reached number one in the US, Canada and the UK. The album was preceded by the top 40 single \"I Bet My Life\", and second and third singles, \"Gold\" and \"Shots\". The band then embarked on a ten month long world tour, which led to a brief hiatus in 2016, with occasional performances and soundtrack contributions throughout the remainder of the year.
Here are a list of Imagine Albums Singles: \"It\u0027s Time\", \"Radioactive\", \"Hear Me\", \"Demons\", \"On Top of the World\", \"Monster\", \"Battle Cry\", \"Warriors\", \"I Bet My Life\", \"Gold\", \"Shots\", \"Roots\", \"I Was Me\", \"Sucker for Pain\", \"Levitate\", \"Believer\", \"Thunder\", \"Whatever It Takes\", \"Next to Me\", \"Born to Be Yours\", \"Natural\", \"Zero\", \"Machine\", \"Bad Liar\", \"Birds\"
Self-identifying as \"genreless\" Imagine Dragons joined forces with producers like Joel Little (Lorde, Khalid), Mattman \u0026 Robin (Selena Gomez, Carly Rae Jepsen), and John Hill (Florence + the Machine, Phantogram) to sculpt the kaleidoscopic and kinetically charged sound of Origins. With the band artfully blending rock, hip-hop, pop, and folk, the album is etched in inventive textures that never distract from an essential element of Imagine Dragons: lyrics that speak to a sometimes-painful self-awareness, but ultimately uplift and inspire.
Imagine Dragons have the top three rock songs of the 2010s on the Billboard charts, \"Believer\", \"Thunder\", and \"Radioactive\".
Top Artists recaps are ranked based on a formula blending performance, as outlined above, of all their chart entries. Specifically, the overall Top Artists category ranks the best-performing artists based on activity on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart and the Billboard 200 albums tally, as well as social media data and touring revenue from Billboard Boxscore, while genre-focused Top Artists rankings blend acts\u0027 decade-spanning performance on each genre\u0027s main song and album charts (such as, for rock, Hot Rock Songs and Top Rock Albums).
Elsewhere on Origins, the band reflects on the many dimensions of romantic love, embodying everything from the restless intensity of \"Boomerang\" to the dreamy melancholy of \"Cool Out\" to the epic balladry of \"Bad Liar.\" And on the soulful and stomping \"West Coast,\" Reynolds muses on a \"fear of neglecting relationships due to the career path I chose,\" gently transforming that fear into a glorious piece of folk-pop.
