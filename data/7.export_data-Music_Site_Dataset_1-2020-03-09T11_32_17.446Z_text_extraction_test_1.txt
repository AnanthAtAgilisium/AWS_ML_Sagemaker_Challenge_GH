After the Evolve Tour was completed, Imagine Dragons released their fourth studio album Origins, on November 9, 2018. \"Natural\" and \"Zero\" were released as the first singles off the album. Afterwards, \"Machine\" and \"Bad Liar\" were also released. A previously released single titled \"Born to Be Yours\" was included on a deluxe version of the album. While all four albums were commercially successful, critical reception was mixed.
Noting that the past year has brought its share of \"high highs and low lows,\" Reynolds partly perceives Origins as a document of those triumphs and troubles. \"I don\u0027t believe in regrets, but in accepting my path where I am each day,\" he says. \"I wrote in the moment, and this record captures a lot of visceral feelings for me -- some of it lamenting loss, some celebrating life. I can\u0027t help but write from an emotional and vulnerable place, as it\u0027s the only place of inspiration for me that\u0027s real.\"
Imagine Dragons is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, consisting of lead vocalist Dan Reynolds, lead guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman
The Las Vegas rockers, who first began charting in March 2012 when their breakthrough single \"It\u0027s Time\" (and its corresponding EP, Continued Silence) began to find an audience at alternative radio, kicked off their Billboard success via debut album Night Visions, which spurred a trio of hit singles.
