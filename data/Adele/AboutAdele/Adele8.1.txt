Various Production is a collective of musicians and producers .
Excessive energy is not put in to self promotion , nor is it the intent to envelope itself in mystery .
The core objective is to focus solely on the music and give a platform for artists to thrive .
Often difficult to define and put into a category Various Production s multigenre spanning music has a common thread  to take the simple and make something complex with depth , always challenging the listener and artist .
Since inception Various Production has been multifaced .
